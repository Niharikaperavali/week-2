    <h2>Beautiful view of horsely hills</h2>
    <p>Located near the southwestern border between Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, Horsley Hills refers to a hill station that is the perfect amalgam of the charms of Andhra Pradesh and the beauty of the hills. It is thus often called, the Ooty of Andhra. This natural marvel is situated at an astonishing height of 1,290 metres and is well-known for its breathtaking landscapes.</p>

    <h2>The Horsely hills places</h2>
    <p>The hill station is centred around the Harita Hill Resort, which is a quaint stopover maintained by Andhra Pradesh Tourism Development Corporation (APTDC). Apart from this, other private resorts such as Holiday Home Castle Wind, Wind Fall Horsley Hill, Wild Wings and Horsley Hills Holiday Home Resorts are also available. Prior reservation needs to be done in the case of availing a government accommodation. You can take your chance with private hotels if going without reservation, but it is best to make the deal in advance, deciding on your package and requirements.</p>
